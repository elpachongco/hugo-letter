# Letter - a hugo theme by earlps.net

Classy and easy on the eyes.

This is the theme of my website, [earlps.net](https://earlps.net).
It follows the [blog redesign checklist](https://earlps.net/2023/11/12/blog-redesign-checklist.html)

## What I like about this theme

- The front page features articles, media and projects unlike the previous theme which only listed the latest posts. It was too simple for my use case.
- Visitors may notice the 'shorts' page. These are low quality, short posts which I use as an alternative to social media. It scratches a particular itch I have -- shitposting. I learned on my Previous experience that I like the experience this gives me. It keeps the blog more active and I have a place to dump thoughts so I can go back to them.
- Posts are more digestible with the laid-back spacing of elements.

## Inspiration

The design of this blog came from multiple websites I've visited in the past.

- [The supabase website](https://supabase.com/blog/ga-week-summary#more-updates)
    - The right sidebar on an article shows a summary, like a table of contents, of the article.
- [Gwern's website](https://gwern.net/)
    - I like the idea of laying out categories in the homepage. It encourages the reader to look around.
- [Lean Rada's personal website](https://leanrada.com/)
    - I like the fun feel and clean look of the website.

## Todo

- Client-side deprioritization of posts that have already been read by the user
- last site update time on footer
- page stats?
- Theme size/lines of code
- Loading animations / page transitions / (trivia loading screen, pokemon transitions)
- Default thumbnail if not found
- Popups like wikipedia (using iframe)
